# Hi, I'm Tayyaba!

An **AI/ML Engineer** with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems and make people's lives easier.  

My journey started with a background in AI, and over time, I've developed a keen interest in **reinforcement learning, generative AI, and intelligent automation**.  

I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities at the intersection of AI and everyday life ‚Äî from crafting smart chatbots and personal assistants to experimenting with agentic AI and AI-driven data analytics. I believe in the power of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a partner in creativity, decision-making, and discovery.

As I look ahead, I'm excited about building **secure, locally hosted AI solutions**, and exploring how AI can help individuals stay productive, organized, and mentally sharp.
